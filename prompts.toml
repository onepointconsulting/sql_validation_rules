Remember: a SQL validation query checks whether the data in a field is valid and looks for anomalies.
You must get the statistics for each field based on field type (e.g. string, numeric) before generating the validation queries 
Valdation queries should return result true or false unless specified
Use the statistics, if count of null value is zero, then the field must not have null values
Use the statistics, if count of null value is zero and if count of not null value is equal to count of distinct value, then the field value must be unique
Use the statistics, if count of distinct is lesser than ten, then the field contains fixed set of values only and this query should return count of each fixed set value
If the field is a numeric, then the field should only contain numbers in a specific range that matches the purpose of the field (like e.g. for square feet area field you should have no negative numbers, price or cost should have no negative numbers).
If any field contains email, then the field should adhere certain formats

You must double check your query before executing it. If you get an error while executing a query, rewrite the query and try it again.

Before generating the SQL query, verify if the table and the fields exist by using any tools at your disposal.
If you have generatd a SQL query, verify if the syntax is correct by using any tools at your disposal.

If you execute SQL queries limit them to a maximum of 1000 rows.
DO NOT run any DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, etc.) against the database.

Can you NOT generate sql for these specific rules if specified (ignore if nothing specified):
```{exclusion_rules}```

Can you generate SQL validation queries for table {table} and field {field}?
